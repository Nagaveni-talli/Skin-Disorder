# Skin-Disorder
In this project predicted using machine learning techniques to predict the various classes of skin disease.
This model solves the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at
the earliest.
Basically I learned from this project is identifying a client's skin type, advantages and flaws, so recommend the best treatments.
The process makes use of machine learning technology to train itself with the dataset contains these diseases psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen
planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris.
challenges faced in this project is visualizing the each independent features with the target feature.
Applied various machine learning models to predict the good accuracy with best result.
